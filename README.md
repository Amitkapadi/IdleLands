# IdleLands [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IdleLands/IdleLands.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IdleLands/IdleLands)

ðŸŽ‰

## Requirements

* Git
* MongoDB (not tested against other DBs)
* Node 10.x

### MongoDB Note

The game is only tested against MongoDB. TypeORM currently lacks support for joins, etc and these are done manually. Additionally, the `seed` process requires using MongoDB. This could be cleaned up in the future, but is not a priority right now.

Additionally, it is recommended to set up a mLab account for your MongoDB tests or you can use our `docker-compose`, which you can run locally via `docker-compose up`.
This will spin up two Docker containers. First one will be your MongoDB database and the second one is tool called Mongo Express. Here you can manage your database collections very easily.

To connect to Docker MongoDB instance create `.env` file (see `Environment Variables`) and set `TYPEORM_URL` environment variable to: `mongodb://admin-user:admin-password@127.0.0.1:27017/admin?retryWrites=true&w=majority`.

To check Mongo Express, open your browser and navigate to: `http:localhost:8081`.


## Getting Started

* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `npm run setup`
* Create `.env` file (see `Environment Variables`)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the cloned project and fill it with these values.

### Required

* `TYPEORM_CONNECTION` - the DB type (you probably want to use `mongodb`)
* `TYPEORM_URL` - the URL to connect to the DB
* `TYPEORM_SYNCHRONIZE` - set to `true`
* `TYPEORM_ENTITIES` - set to `src/shared/models/entity/**/*.ts`

### Optional

#### Game Variables

These variables will change how the game plays.

* `GAME_DELAY` - the game loop delay (each tick is 1 `GAME_DELAY`). Default: `5000`ms.
* `SAVE_DELAY` - the number of ticks the game will save per interval. Default `15`ticks.
* `GRACE_PERIOD_DISCONNECT` - the delay between disconnect and character exiting game. Default: `30000`ms.

#### Redis Variables

Redis variables will enable use of Redis to scale horizontally.

* `SCC_BROKER_REDIS_HOST` - the URL to the Redis instance
* `SCC_BROKER_REDIS_PORT` - the port of the Redis instance

#### Firebase Variables

Firebase variables are used to set up Firebase, which is used only to sync accounts based on a uid.

* `FIREBASE_ADMIN_DATABASE` - the admin database URL for firebase. Should be in the format `https://<DATABASE_NAME>.firebaseio.com`.
* `FIREBASE_ADMIN_JSON` - the JSON blob (stringified) for a service account private key. You can read how to do that [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup). This needs to be encoded as base64 with LZUTF8.

#### Stripe Variables

Stripe variables need to be set up to accept payments via Stripe.

* `STRIPE_KEY` the private stripe key.

#### Discord Variables

Discord variables are used to connect to Discord, which will sync chat between the game/Discord. You will also need to set up a Discord bot and give it sufficient permissions to post messages/emoji, create/modify channels, and create/modify roles. Your bot will either need to be an administrator or have these permissions. 

* `DISCORD_SECRET` - the Discord API secret for your created Discord bot
* `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` - the Discord guild ID for the Discord bot to reside in
* `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` - the Discord channel ID for the chat bridge
* `DISCORD_CUSTOM_ITEM_CHANNEL_ID` - the Discord channel ID to send custom item submissions to
* `DISCORD_GUILD_CHANNEL_GROUP_ID` - the Discord channel CATEGORY ID to put guild channels in

You will also need the following roles:

* `Verified`
* `Guild Mod`

#### IdleLands 3 Variables

IL3 variables are used to connect to the old DB for the purposes of character imports.

* `IDLELANDS3_MONGODB_URI` - the MongoDB URI to the old IdleLands 3 Mongo instance

## Useful Commands

* `npm run start:server` - start the server
* `npm run start:client` - start the client

## Improving Server Performance on Windows

If you have trouble or slowness running IdleLands server on Windows, try using `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1` as an env variable. This will alleviate most issues.

## Making Yourself A GM

To test any moderator-related features, you will need to be a GM. Doing so is as easy a quick DB query:

```
db.getCollection('player').update({ name: 'YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME' }, { $set: { modTier: 5 } });
```
