# Contributing to IdleLands!

Welcome, and thanks for taking a peek here! This will tell you how to get started with IdleLands contributions.

Lets talk about the types of contributions you can make:

## Issues

In general, opening an issue is fine. However, some issues are not actionable. Things of this nature include:

* Connection Issues

If your issue falls into a category above, you might be better off sending a Discord message.

If you would like to open an issue, usually these will cover:

* New Features
* Bug Reports
* Game Ideas

Some issues may be closed as they come in due to either the scope of work, the issue being duplicated, or other reasons. Your idea may not be bad, but it may not fit into the game quite as the game is designed. Additionally, what you perceive as a bug may be a feature (yes, it happens!) so please be patient - your report may spur a re-design of a particular feature, or it may not.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests are always welcome! Please either address a specific issue, or make sure your PR will not conflict with anything. As always, you must test your code before submitting a PR. If you plan to work on something, coordinate with the dev team to make sure your work is within the scope of the project.

Your PR must also pass all of the testing checks in place before it will be considered.
